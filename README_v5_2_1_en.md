# Delegator v5.2.1: Large-Scale Scalable Condition-Based Maintenance Planning System

## 🎯 Overview

Delegator v5.2.1 is a large-scale scalable condition-based maintenance planning system using OptSeq-based parallel processing degradation-responsive scheduler. It evaluates degradation states from playground equipment inspection results and automatically generates optimal maintenance schedules for large-scale datasets supporting up to 1,331 equipment items.

🎯 **Background: Public Park Safety and Maintenance in Japan**

Since 2018, annual inspections of playground equipment in public parks have been mandated across Japan. Park administrators (Coordinators) are responsible for monitoring the physical condition of over 1,000 playground units in more than 200 parks. Within limited budgets and increasing constraints on resources—such as rising material costs and labor shortages—they must plan and execute cost-efficient repair and replacement schedules to uphold safety.

Each year, Coordinators face bottlenecks in both budget allocation and field execution. Securing skilled maintenance crews (Workers) and managing construction priorities under fiscal and workforce limitations adds further complexity. As such, park management presents a classic **CWD (Coordinators, Worker, Delegator)** problem, requiring state-responsive planning that balances safety, feasibility, and public value.

To address this challenge, Delegators—AI agents tasked with long-term maintenance scheduling—must construct responsive plans based on inspection-informed degradation states. They aim to ensure sustainable safety levels while adapting to complex, large-scale, and uncertain infrastructure conditions.

In this context, we developed  **Delegator v5.2.1** , a Minimum Viable Product built upon the  **Agentic CWD framework** , leveraging real inspection data and parallelized state-based optimization. This system enables park administrators to generate cost-effective, safety-conscious schedules at scale.

## 🔍 Algorithm Details

### Degradation Score Calculation

```python
def compute_degradation_batch(equipment_list, inspection_dict):
    # Age-based degradation
    age_factor = min(age / 60, 1.0)  # Complete degradation in 60 years
  
    # Inspection result correction
    grade_scores = {'a': 0.1, 'b': 0.3, 'c': 0.5, 'd': 0.7, 'e': 0.9}
    inspection_factor = grade_scores.get(grade, 0.3)
  
    # Weighted average
    degradation_score = 0.6 * age_factor + 0.4 * inspection_factor
    return min(max(degradation_score, 0.0), 1.0)
```

### Priority-based Scheduling

```python
def solve_parallel(strategy="greedy_priority"):
    # Priority sorting
    sorted_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda t: (-t.priority, t.latest_end, -t.penalty_coefficient))
  
    # Constraint satisfaction scheduling
    for task in sorted_tasks:
        for year in range(task.earliest_start, task.latest_end + 1):
            if (annual_cost[year] + task.cost <= budget and
                annual_count[year] + 1 <= capacity):
                # Schedule determination
                schedule[task.id] = {
                    'scheduled_year': year,
                    'delay_years': max(0, year - task.earliest_start),
                    'penalty': task.penalty_late(delay_years)
                }
